== Anatomy of a Wiki Header

*pass:[=]* Mandatory. Title of your document.

*pass:[:]author:* Optional. Document author.

*pass:[:]revnumber:* Optional. Revision number.

*pass:[:]revdate:* Optional. Revision Date

*pass:[:]relfileprefix:* Mandatory. Enter a path to the "`asciidoc`" folder. Use `Tree View` (kbd:[ctrl]+kbd:[\ ] or `menu:View[Toggle Tree View]`) to locate the "`asciidoc`" folder. In the example below, "asciidoc" is two folders above the folder this file is located in.

`pass:[:]relfileprefix: ../../`

*pass:[:]imagesdir:* Mandatory. Enter a path to the "images" folder. Use `Tree View` (kbd:[ctrl]+kbd:[\ ] or `menu:View[Toggle Tree View]`) to locate the "`images`" folder. In the example below, "images" is two folders above the folder this file is located in.

`pass:[:]imagesdir: ../..`

[TIP]
====
A simple way to determine the location of the "asciidoc" and "images" folder is first save the file, btn:[RMB] select the saved file and select btn:[Copy Project Path].

Temporarily paste this into your document to see where the "`asciidoc`" folder is located.

For example: `src\docs\asciidoc\jme3\advanced\3d_models.adoc`

In this example, "asciidoc" is located two folders above the "advanced" folder `3d_models.adoc` resides in. The "`images`" folder resides in the same folder as the "`asciidoc`" folder so it has the same setting minus the kbd:[/ ].
