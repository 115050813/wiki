You can run example code by opening an included JME3Tests project and included assets. You can also search the built-in documentation or drag and drop code snippets from the Palette in the SDK to get short code sample.



== Code Palette and Samples in the SDK

*  Type a keyword into the search box in the SDK or press F1 to search the built-in help for sample code.
*  <<sdk/code_editor#,SDK code editor and palette>>


== The JME3Tests Project Template

The jMonkeyEngine SDK contains a Test Project with lots of sample code and assets. The Test Project is all set up and ready to run, and it's easy to use for beginners (no need to mess with classpaths or libraries).


.  Install and Open the jMonkeyEngine <<sdk/sdk#,SDK>>
.  Go to File→New Project
.  In the New Project Wizard, select `JME3 Tests` from the `JME3` category. Click Next.
.  Specify a location, e.g. create a jMonkeyProjects directory in your home directory. Click Finish.

This default project template creates a project called `JmeTests`. It contains all test classes and examples from the jme3 source repository. Feel free to modify the code samples and experiment! In the unlikely event that you should break the project, emoji:smiley you can always recreate all packaged samples by creating another project from the New Project wizard's `JME3 Tests` template.






== JME3TestData Assets

You may want access to some sample assets, such as 3D models or textures, in one of your projects. A common situation for this would be while going through the <<jme3/beginner#,beginner tutorials>>.


.  Right-click an existing jME3 project in the <<sdk/sdk#,SDK>>, and select Properties.
.  In the Properties window, select the Libraries section. Go to the Compile tab, it contains compile-time libraries.
.  Click the Add Library… button and select the pre-defined `jme3-test-data`. Click OK.
.  Click OK to save and close the Properties.

The project's assetManager now has access to sample files from the `jme3-test-data.jar` file. This JAR library contains


*  Ogre XML Models: Ninja.mesh.xml, Oto.mesh.xml, HoverTank.mesh.xml, Sinbad.mesh.xml, and many more
*  Blender models
*  Materials and Textures
**  Terrain, sky, rock, brick, pond…
**  Particle effect textures

*  Sounds
*  And more…


== AssetPacks

If you need sample 3D models, don't miss the opportunity to download our community-provided <<sdk/asset_packs#,Asset Packs>>!


In the SDK:


*  Open the AssetPackBrowser from the Windows menu
*  In the AssetPackBrowser, click the Online AssetPacks button
*  Click install on the AssetPack of your choice. The SDK downloads it and makes the assets accessible in your AssetPack Library.
*  Click the View Library button and open the Assets node. 
*  Right-click an asset to
**  Preview it
**  Add it to the SceneComposer
**  Add it to a game project's assets directory
