If you've been working on a large scene in the SDK, there is a good chance that you will need to increase the size of Java's heap space (which is quite small by default). link:http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-1996/jw-08-gc.html[What is heap space?]


To increase the amount of heap space allocated to the SDK, we must navigate to the SDK's installation directory and edit the etc/jmonkeyplatform.conf file.


The installation directory for Mac and Windows is:


*+++<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>+++ X:* Applications/jmonkeyplatform.app/Contents/Resources/jmonkeyplatform/jmonkeyplatform


*Windows:* C:\Program Files\jmonkeyplatform
