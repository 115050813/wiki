jMonkeyEngine 3 has a wide range of support for Virtual Reality (VR). The known supported systems are:
HTC Vive and systems supporting SteamVR/OpenVR
Razer HDK and systems supporting OSVR
Google Cardboard / GoogleVR
Legacy: Oculus Rift 0.5

In any form of VR, a library is needed as support is not built in to the core of jMonkeyEngine3.

== jMonkeyVR (https://github.com/phr00t/jMonkeyVR)
This is the main library to use when you want wide VR support. It has full OpenVR/SteamVR support and OSVR support in the making (as of Oct 2016)

== jme3-osvr (https://github.com/neph1/jme3-osvr)
Together with https://github.com/neph1/OSVR-Java provides rudimentary OSVR support (extended mode). Examples: https://github.com/neph1/jme3-osvr-examples

== gvr-android-jme (https://github.com/nordfalk/gvr-android-jme)
